   * When a camera scrolls it will change the location at which this Game Object is rendered on-screen. It does not change the Game Objects actual position values.
   *
   * A value of 1 means it will move exactly in sync with a camera. A value of 0 means it will not move at all, even if the camera moves. Other values control the degree to which the camera movement is mapped to this Game Object

   * Please be aware that scroll factor values other than 1 are not taken in to consideration when calculating physics collisions. Bodies always collide based on their world position, but changing the scroll factor is a visual adjustment to where the textures are rendered, which can offset them from physics bodies if not accounted for in your code.
